## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch? 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1. Git is a Version control system, Git allows us to store code on the cloud as well as allows other developers 
to work on the code. Git keeps 
track of our code and the changes thats made to it over time.p
2. Github is where we store our repositories, like a folder
Git is the commands that we run in the terminal app
3. Branching is created when there is multiple developers working on the same project. To avoid the errors and 
mistakes that can be made our code. It allows us to be able to edit a specific code with a duplicate branch and 
then eventually merge it back with the original and everyone elses after review of said code.
4. The purpose of a pull request is to push the feature branch back into the main branch
5. git branch ex: git branch tiasha-george
6. Git merge is when you merge the feature branch back with the main. Git pull command allows you to push the 
commits in your repository to the online storage GitHub. Git fetch dowloads data from the other repository.
7. A merge conflict is when people make different changes to a file and it has competing commits.
8. To resolve a merge conflict you must manually edit the file and select the changes you want to keep in the 
merge (I'm still confused on this topic considering the fact I havent been taught about this yet fully).
